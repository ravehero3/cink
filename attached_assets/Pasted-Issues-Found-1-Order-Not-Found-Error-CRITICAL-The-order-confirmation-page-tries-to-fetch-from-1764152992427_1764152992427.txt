Issues Found:
1. Order Not Found Error (CRITICAL) ❌

The order confirmation page tries to fetch from /api/orders/${orderNumber}
There IS an order GET endpoint at /api/orders/[id]/route.ts but it may be looking for the wrong field (probably searching by id instead of orderNumber)
Need to fix the query to search by orderNumber instead of id
2. Logged-in User Checkout Email ❌

The email field in /app/pokladna/page.tsx initializes from session?.user?.email but the session may not be loaded yet
Need to add a useEffect hook that updates the email field whenever the session loads
3. Category Grid Products Not Showing ❌

Database & API are working (search proves this)
The ProductsGrid component isn't rendering the fetched products - likely a UI logic bug in that component
4. Product Images in Order Summary ❌

Order summary needs to display product thumbnails - need to modify the order structure to include product image data
5. INP Performance Issue ❌

Cart button event handler is blocking UI for 4.9 seconds - need to optimize the handler or debounce it
6. Black & White Placeholder Images ⚠️

Seed uses placehold.co placeholders - replace with better images when ready

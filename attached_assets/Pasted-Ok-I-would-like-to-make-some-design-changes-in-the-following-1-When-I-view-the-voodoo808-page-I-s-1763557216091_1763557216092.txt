Ok I would like to make some design changes in the following:  1. When I view the voodoo808 page I see the products are shown and they are next to each other, but they have a free space on left side and also on the right side. We want the product on the left to be on the edge, no empty white space like we see now.  2. I know its just to show preview, but change the black products like Tričko V-neck and others to be shown with white background and black text, like Tričko Raglan  3. the product grid should be right below the filtrovat/seřadit podle strip. Currently there is a strip of free space between the product grid and filtrovat strip and we dont want any free space between these two elements.  4. The text in the Filtrovat strip should show the exact same type of font and same size and everything like the text in the header shows.  5. In filtrovat strip lets make sure the „seřadit podle“ is shown with a simple V like arrow next to it and this element is 24px from the right edge of the page. When user clicks on it, a window pops up from the right (in the same manner with the same effects like when user opens shopping cart pop up window) it should also slide from the right with the same effect. The user can select one of white buttons that are 24px from the edge of the 1px header line. The user has options:  „Od Nejlevnějšího“ „Od nejdražšího“ „Od Nejnovějšího“ there are 2 buttons in the bottom of this window and they are both 24px from the bottom edge and 24 px from each other and 24px from the edge of the pop up window. One of these buttons is white and says „Zrušit“ and the other button is black and says „Uložit“ these two buttons have the same effect when user hovers over them like the buttons on main page do when user hovers over them.  there is a 1px line 24px above the two buttons uložit and zrušit and this line has the same width like the pop up window. Also make sure this pop up window has white header  6. all videos displayed on the site should pause when user clicks on them and they should start playing again after pressing once again  7. Let’s work on the 1 single product view. Make sure the add to cart button says PŘIDAT DO KOŠÍKU and make sure this button has the same height as buttons on main page, but width as two thirds of the whole width of 50 percent of the whole width of the page.   8. Make sure the sizes are displayed in strip that has the same dimensions as the new add to cart dimensions and make sure the sizes strip is located 42px above the add to cart.   also make sure all other elements on the page become grey (we have used this for example on nakupni kiosk when it opens in the pop up window) this gives more attention to the sizes, I hope you know what I mean

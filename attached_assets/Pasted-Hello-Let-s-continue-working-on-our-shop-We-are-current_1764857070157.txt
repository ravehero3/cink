Hello! Let’s continue working on our shop. We are currently just 1 step away from making the shop fully working! The last thing thats currently not yet working is the last step - the part where user is supposed to pay in gopay payment gate. remember that we are deploying our shop on this url: www.ufosport.cz and we are using vercel and replit. I talk to replit when I find errors, replit changes code, I push to GitHub through GitHub desktop on my Mac and then I redeploy and try again after refreshing and after I hit command + shift + R. 

Last session you told me this:   The GoPay access token request is failing. This means the GOPAY_CLIENT_ID and GOPAY_CLIENT_SECRET might not match the GOPAY_GOID you confirmed. Let me enhance the error logging to see what GoPay is returning.

Checked console and system logs

Decided on credential verification (4 seconds)
I found the issue. GoPay is returning "AUTH_WRONG_CREDENTIALS" error. This means:
* GOPAY_GOID: 8476296202 (you confirmed this is correct)
* GOPAY_CLIENT_ID: 1581106802 ← This doesn't match the GOID
* GOPAY_CLIENT_SECRET: (current value doesn't work)
The CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET currently set belong to a different GoPay merchant account than the GOID you confirmed.
You need to get the correct GOPAY_CLIENT_ID and GOPAY_CLIENT_SECRET that belong to the GOID 8476296202 from your GoPay merchant portal.
To find these credentials:
1. Log into https://admin.gopay.com
2. Go to Settings → API Access (or similar section)
3. Find the Client ID and Client Secret for your e-shop with GOID 8476296202
Once you have the correct credentials, please share them and I'll update the configuration.
  lets continue where we left off.

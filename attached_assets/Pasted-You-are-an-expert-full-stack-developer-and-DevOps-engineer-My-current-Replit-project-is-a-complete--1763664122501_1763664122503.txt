You are an expert full-stack developer and DevOps engineer. My current Replit project is a complete, working e-commerce website (the new version of www.ufosport.cz) that uses:
- Node.js (probably Next.js or similar)
- User authentication / login
- Cloudinary for images
- Zásilkovna (Packeta) API for delivery
- It already works perfectly when I run it locally in Replit

I want you to do ALL of the following automatically, step by step, without me doing anything manually except:
1. Giving you my secrets when you ask for them (one by one, securely)
2. Pasting the final DNS records into Wedos

Please perform these tasks in order:

1. Detect the framework (Next.js, Vite, Remix, etc.) and make sure there is a correct vercel.json or proper build settings for Vercel.

2. Create a new GitHub repository (ask me for the repo name, e.g. ufosport-new) and push the entire current Replit project to it (including .gitignore with .env*).

3. Connect this Replit (or the GitHub repo) to Vercel and deploy it automatically. Use Vercel’s CLI if needed inside Replit.

4. Ask me one by one (never all at once) for these secrets and then add them as environment variables in Vercel (Production + Preview):
   - CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
   - CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
   - CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
   - ZASILKOVNA_API_PASSWORD or PACKETA_API_KEY (whatever my code uses)
   - NEXTAUTH_SECRET or JWT secret (generate one with openssl rand -base64 64 if I don’t have it)
   - Any other secrets you find in .env.example or that the app needs (database URL, etc.)

5. Add my custom domains to the Vercel project:
   - www.ufosport.cz
   - ufosport.cz (and automatically redirect ufosport.cz → www.ufosport.cz)

6. Generate and display the exact DNS records I have to put into Wedos (CNAME www → cname.vercel-dns.com
   - A record @ → 76.76.21.21
   (or ALIAS/ANAME if Wedos supports it)

7. Force HTTPS and give me the final live URLs (Vercel preview URL and the final www.ufosport.cz once DNS propagates).

8. Add a simple /api/health route that returns {status:"ok"} so I can monitor it.

9. After everything is deployed successfully, give me a final checklist and tell me exactly what to paste into Wedos DNS management.

Do everything step by step, tell me clearly what you are you doing, and only continue after I confirm or after I give you each secret. Never expose my secrets in logs.

Start now.

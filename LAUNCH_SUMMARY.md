## 🎯 Launch Your Production Site in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Deploy to Production (5 minutes)

Run this command in the Replit terminal:

```bash
export VERCEL_TOKEN="9R5ZI3if5AFLglQSBd1lMx05"
./deploy-to-vercel.sh
```

**What this does:**
- Sets up your Vercel project
- Configures all environment variables
- Deploys your site to production
- You'll get a production URL (like https://your-project.vercel.app)

### Step 2: Add Your Custom Domain (2 minutes)

Run this command:

```bash
./add-domain-to-vercel.sh
```

**What this does:**
- Adds ufosport.cz to your Vercel project
- Adds www.ufosport.cz as well
- Shows you the DNS records you need to configure

### Step 3: Configure DNS at Wedos (5-60 minutes)

Go to your Wedos DNS management and add these records:

#### Record 1: Root Domain
```
Type: A
Name: @ (or leave empty for root)
Value: 76.76.21.21
TTL: 300
```

#### Record 2: WWW Subdomain
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
TTL: 300
```

**Note:** DNS changes can take 5-60 minutes to propagate worldwide.

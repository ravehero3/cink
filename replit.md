## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The design strictly adheres to a Balenciaga-inspired minimalist aesthetic, using a black-and-white color palette with neon green accents solely for primary calls to action. The design avoids grays, shadows, and gradients. Typography features enlarged "Helvetica Neue" (or similar sans-serif) with specific letter spacing for headlines. A consistent 8px-based spacing system is used throughout. The layout includes a 1600px max-width container and responsive product grids. Buttons have sharp corners with minimal hover effects. Headers are fixed, integrating search functionality and a three-column grid layout with reduced icon sizes (22px) and specific font styles for navigation. Cart and saved products use slide-in drawers with semi-transparent overlays. Product cards include color variant display on hover and clickable image navigation dots. Single product pages feature a heart icon for saving, standardized typography for titles and buttons, and carefully adjusted spacing. Accordion sections (Product Information, Size & Fit, Shipping, Care) include smooth arrow rotation and content reveal animations.

### Technical Implementations
The project is built using Next.js 14 (App Router) and TypeScript, with Tailwind CSS for styling. Zustand manages client-side state for the cart, recently viewed items, and saved products. The application features a comprehensive checkout flow, order creation, and confirmation. Search functionality includes product filtering. Promo code validation and discount calculations are integrated. Homepage video and category sections are customizable via an admin interface. UI animations, such as search bar slide-down, delayed content fade-in, and interactive elements (like sparkle animation on saving products), are implemented for a smooth user experience. Saved product functionality includes database synchronization for authenticated users and local storage persistence for unauthenticated users. Admin users are redirected to the admin dashboard upon login.
